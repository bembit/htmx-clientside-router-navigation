## HTMX Client-Side Routing

This is a simple library for client-side routing with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).

More like a navigation tbh.

There are X branches with different features and different use cases.
- None of them use localstorage, except the first 1.hx-push-url="true" example.

### Why?

- Built for my specific edge use cases, purely for client-side.
- Managing popstate render.

It's quite nice to have simple SPA like static sites with HTMX. No dealing with fetch, render. All I was missing is a bit of "routing" to handle the URLs, popstate. Don't leave the page accidentally.

### How?

- Added a small demo.
- And some missing features of htmx, like neon colors and gradients.
